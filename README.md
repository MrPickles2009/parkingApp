# JMU Parking App

We developed an npm package used to determine where anyone can park at James Madison University between the hours of 7 a.m.- 4 p.m. on weekdays.

This package was created for visitors, residents, commuters and staff at JMU. This package will list the available places on campus that anyone can park at. We created this package to help diminish the nightmare of on-campus parking at JMU.
